## DAY1 [31 JAN] =>Add basic sequential workflows using LangGraph

- Implemented simple sequential workflows using LangGraph
- Explored core LangGraph concepts:
  - Graph: defines execution structure
  - Node: atomic unit of computation
  - Edge: controls execution order between nodes
  - State: shared data passed and mutated across nodes
  - Reducers: define how state updates are merged
- Understood LangGraph execution model:
  - Execution starts from entry point
  - Nodes run deterministically based on graph definition
  - LLM is treated as a callable node, not the controller
- Built linear workflows to internalize:
  - Deterministic step-by-step execution
  - Clear separation of logic vs intelligence
- Established basic code structure:
  - Define State schema
  - Define node functions
  - Define edges and entry point
  - Compile and invoke graph
